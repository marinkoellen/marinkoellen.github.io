                <p> Recruited as a Mathematics & Statistics graduate in 2018, I am currently working in the 
                    Algorithms & Applications team in BHP’s Technology function in Perth, Western Australia. 
                    In this role, I enjoy researching and designing creative solutions using mathematics, 
                    statistics and machine learning to help address business challenges.

                <p> At the moment I have challenged myself to study web application development part time so I can expand my skill set and use
                    both web development and analytics to have more impact in my current role and help people make 
                    better decisions using data by building accessible analytics tools.
